Each tuple will be constructed with one element of as and one of bs. But if one list runs out of element before the other, zip will not be able to construct a tuple, since it only has one of the required elements. The best option that zip has is stopping the construction of the list of tuples, meaning that any left over sub-lists will not be included in the result. For example, say that as = List(List(11), List(12), List(13)) and bs = List(List(21), List(22)). Then the first definition will result in List(List(11, 21), List(12, 22), List(13)), but the second definition will stop after the second sub-list and result in List(List(11, 21), List(12, 22))\n",
